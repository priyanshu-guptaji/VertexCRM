- `DripCampaignStepRepository` - Ordered step retrieval
- `CampaignMetricsRepository` - Campaign performance data

**Service Automation Repositories:**

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Multi-Tenancy Support
✅ All entities include `Organization` relationship
✅ All repositories filter by organization
✅ Tenant isolation maintained through existing `TenantContext`

### Automation Triggers
The system supports various automation triggers:
- **Lead Activities**: Email opens, clicks, form submissions
- **Deal Events**: Stage changes, quote sent, proposal sent
- **Time-based**: Inactivity detection via scheduled jobs
- **Campaign Events**: Drip campaign step execution

### Database Design
- **Normalized schema** with proper foreign keys
- **Audit fields**: `created_at`, `updated_at` on all entities
- **Soft deletes**: `is_active` flags for logical deletion
- **Versioning**: `updated_at` tracked automatically via `@PreUpdate`

export const getLeadScores = () => api.get('/sales/lead-scores');
export const getTopLeads = (minScore) => api.get(`/sales/top-leads?minScore=${minScore}`);
export const getPipelines = () => api.get('/sales/pipelines');

// RBAC
export const getPermissions = () => api.get('/rbac/permissions');
export const getRolePermissions = (roleId) => api.get(`/rbac/roles/${roleId}/permissions`);

```

### Protected Route Example

```jsx
import { useAuth } from './contexts/AuthContext';

  }
  
  return children;
};
```
