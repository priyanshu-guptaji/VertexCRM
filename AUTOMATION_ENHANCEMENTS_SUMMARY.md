# CRM Automation Enhancements - Completion Summary

This document summarizes the additional automation enhancements that were implemented to complete the optional requirements.

## 1. Backend Automation Components

### 1.1 Custom Event Classes
Created custom Spring event classes to support the automation system:

- `LeadActivityEvent.java` - Event for lead activity triggers
- `DealStageChangeEvent.java` - Event for deal stage transitions
- `TicketCreatedEvent.java` - Event for new ticket creation
- `TicketStatusChangeEvent.java` - Event for ticket status changes
- `TicketSlaBreachEvent.java` - Event for SLA breach notifications

### 1.2 Automation Scheduler
Implemented `AutomationScheduler.java` with scheduled tasks:

- **Lead Nurturing**: Hourly checks for inactive leads
- **Deal Follow-ups**: Bi-hourly checks for stale deals
- **SLA Monitoring**: 30-minute checks for SLA breaches
- **Lead Scoring**: Daily updates at 2 AM

### 1.3 Enhanced Repository Methods
Added custom query methods to repositories:

- `LeadRepository.findLeadsWithNoRecentActivity()`
- `DealRepository.findStaleDeals()`
- `TicketRepository.findTicketsNeedingSLAMonitoring()`

### 1.4 Extended Service Methods
Added new methods to automation services:

- `SalesAutomationService.triggerDealFollowUp()`
- `SalesAutomationService.calculateLeadScore()`
- `MarketingAutomationService.triggerLeadNurturing()`
- `ServiceAutomationService.handleSLABreach()` (made public)

## 2. Frontend Dashboard Components
